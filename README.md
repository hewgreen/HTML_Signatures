# HTML_Signatures
These are the signatures I use. They can be easily adapted by others. Feel free to use my monotone button images hosted on thepsychologytree.com.

The buttons are also here and can be easily adapted and made into different colors. How to do this in photoshop see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nm8yQtF9Xs. To see how to add the email signature for mac mail see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpSFoMPi3ug and see below.

## How to add signature for mac sierra v 10.12.5 

1. open mac mail and make a signature file and add placeholder text. FULLY CLOSE MAC MAIL!
2. nav to /Users/username/Library/Mail/V4/MailData/Signatures (I use ```cd``` in bash then ```open .```)
3. find the signature file just created (by date sort)
4. paste the html from my file (adapted as you need) into the placeholder
5. ensure you lock the file so mail doesn't alter it. this is why we closed the program at the start. lock by clicking 'get info' and finding the tickbox or ```chflags uchg ~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData/Signatures*.mailsignature``` to lock files. If you mess up, you can unlock the files with this command. ```chflags nouchg ~Library/Mail/V4/MailData/Signatures*.mailsignature```

I hope this helps. If it has please give me feedback.

Kind regards,

Matt
